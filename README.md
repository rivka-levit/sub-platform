# 📰 Subscription Platform

### Overview

This is a Django-based subscription platform that allows two types of users — 
writers and clients — to register and interact within the system. Writers 
can create and publish articles, while clients can subscribe to different 
plans to access those articles.

The platform supports standard and premium subscription tiers, offering 
varying levels of access to content. It is designed for scalability and ease 
of deployment using Docker.

    cd sub-platform
   ```
   
2. Configure Environment
    ```
    cp .env.example .env
   ```
    
    Copy .env.example to .env and configure settings like database 
    credentials, Django secret key, etc.


3. Build and Run the Containers
    The app will be available at: http://localhost:8000
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
   ```

<br>

### 💡 Subscription Plans

| Plan      | Access Level           |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Standard  | Limited article access |
| Premium   | Full article access    |

Access logic is enforced in views and templates based on the client's current 
subscription status.

<br>

### 🔐 Authentication

- Users can register as either writer or client.
- The role determines the dashboard and available features.
- Permissions and access control are managed via Django’s CustomUser model and custom decorators/mixins.
